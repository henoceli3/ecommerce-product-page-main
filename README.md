## My process
I first started with the navigation bar. I made the skeleton with HTML then I styled them with CSS. I used JavaScript to make the shopping cart appear and disappear as well as the menu on mobile.

As for the rest of the page, it's classic. JavaScript in particular has been fundamental to the rest of the page.

I had fun doing the responsiveness of the same screen widths, it wasn't easy, but I did my best.

I count on your comments and recommendations to be more productive.

It was a real pleasure to take up this challenge.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascripte

### What I learned

On this project, I learned how to make slideshows with JavaScript.
